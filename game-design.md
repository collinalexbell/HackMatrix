# HackMatrix (v1)
In this game, you will code your own 3d desktop environment

## Deadline:
New Years. I will succeed.
How?
Faith. A mind closed to failure.
Persistent continuous action.
## What do I love about Gianetica
- It brings computing into the physical and social realm
- It gives people mental power
- It will help me to know everything about Portland
- It will help me to love software engineering and cybernetics development
- It will help me love portland
- I will be able to connect better with others
- I built it
- It is a 3d linux system
- It will immerse people and connect them
- It will make computing free again (in the VR era)
- It is written in C++
## Audio
I really need to think about audio
I want to introduce the world to trance music and would love to include all trance songs
, but I don't think I could get that many liscenses.

Maybe I should just natively support spotify so people can use their own music
## Purpose
Immerse people in their projects by making them feel like they are in a magical fiction novel while doing their work

Show the love of God

Commune with others while working on thier projects from anywhere in the world
## Game Theme
- Living in a crystal city filled with cybernetic organisms
- Divine/magical power and hormony
     beyond one's comprehension
   is available to those who seek it
       and learn to harmonize themselves
           with the spirit of Wralda
              and the love of other free people
## Essential Experience
- Concious hackers
- transform their own city
- and become fully enlightened cyber soveriegns
## Questions that arise from the purpose
### What are the problems with current methods of immersion?

#### Lack of social connection
I grew up in a semi-rural suburban area with few hackers.

I didn't have many hacker friends or many friends with similar interests.

Most of my work has been done alone.

The best and most productive times of my life
have been when I have worked with others
in fully immersive hackathon like experiences.

The current desktop experience is largely isolating and a solitary endevour.

If I make the experience into a multi-player game, then it would be more fun!

#### Having the code editor so decoupled from the application is lame.
I want to be able to edit my game in my game. HackMatrix allows me to do that.

### How does it go about doing this?
Embeds the hacker in a 3d hacker environment


## Development
### Process
- Attack and keep attacking
- Conciousness reset. (raise above, every day, each week)
### Tickets
- $Fix block placement outside of first chunk
- Get multi chunk scrolling working
- Fix level saving (probably negative coordinates issue)
### Milestones
#### Pre kickstarter
- 10 cities in voxels (maybe it is better just to use one city?) (maybe not)
  - Chunking
  - Elevations
  - Map to street
  - Smooth elevation changes (for streets)
- 1 demo in each of the lesson categories

#### Maybes

- Robots
- Choose IDE level
- 3 challenges
  $ path finding algo, with sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W8hNdEUFbc
  - neural network with visualization: https://github.com/wmvanvliet/scns/tree/main/visualizations/multilayer_perceptron & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsvxx-GGlTg
  - cellular automata: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQJ5aEsP6Fs

- Fully functioning windows (right clicks)
- Ability to open and close arbitrary programs (fully functioning WM)
- Window highlight

- 3 enchant objects in your environment
  - Open a video when you click on a fictional character
  - Make a voxel follow you.
  - Make voxel shoot you when you try to go on twitter.

- Cyberpunk castle
  - art gallery
- 3 coding utlities
- Fake multiplayer (or some shit)


#### Path
   - Meshing
   - World Building
     - Buildings
     - Plants/Parks
   - Mechanics
   - Levels
   - Finishing Touches
   - Marketing Materials
   - Launch

### Process
- Simply make the best game I can
- Use short-wave intervals (per commit basis)
- Keep polishing and compressing it like a diamond
       - like how Mickey Singer viewed his medical manager code
- Modulate the time I spend doing various tasks in the short-wave
       - do important tasks (matrix/phoenix infode improvements longer)

### Momentum
- Working on this game is draining, even with faith
- I will keep short-wave momentum up until plans for achieving better momentum are transfered from infinite intelligence
- Every day, no exception
## Story
You are a cybernetician. We all are.
Thats why we chose to live here, in the City of Cybernetics.

Nestled in the Pacific Northwest,
at the confluence of the Willamete and Columbia river,
lies our beautiful city, once called Portland, now called the City of Cybernetics.

We collectively transformed it with our digital imaginings.
They called it a video game, but we called it our future and then made it so.
How else was a complex city supposed to be planned?... in meatspace?
No, first we created it in our collective digital mind, then in reality
We simulated the city of our wildest dreams:
  With alternate economies,
    improved poltical systems,
      and harmonious relationships

  Now we live there and this is our history:
    Welcome to the City of Cybernetics!
### missions

- Perhaps, I could structure the game by class, where each class is itself a game!
- Users must write a computer program that solves problems in the environment.
- Students learn by doing side quests that teach them the concepts required for OS work

Example:
- Users must draw an image to their screen and take a picture of it. Neural networks will analyze that the image is accurate

? Get a food delivery to a person on time: Upload a map to a robot and have it use the map to navigate to the correct location. Or just have it sort things out without a map entirely, just using cardinal directions or something... or street numbers.

### questions
- what choices must the player make?
- how will those choices effect the experience?
### game story types and their potential for City of Cybernetics
#### strings and pearls
##### what
cut scene -> level -> cutscene -> level
##### potential in City of Cybernetics
#### story generator
sims or roller coaster tycoon, "no author"
I might want to add sims elements to my game

## Mechanics
### Cybernetics
- The game objects (not the environment) occupy a voxel space that is 100x smaller
  than the environment.
- Or, maybe I can use pre-existing cad software and seamlessly yeet the models into the game
### Economics:
    Ownership, both communal and private

    Logos Coin

    By the year 2030,
    The City of Cybernetics produces
    a municipal  revenue
    higher than any other city,
    which allows it to povide a Universal Basic Income
    that is equivalent to a 2020's high end STEM salary

    The UBI is generated by its large stock ownership
    in The Tree of Life Cybernetics Corp which acts as
    a utility corporation to help citizens produce cybernetics
    which they use internally to run the city, as well as export to other
    municipalities.
    
#### KarmaCoin
Since all goods are reproducible, the primary currency in game is [KarmaCoin](https://github.com/collinalexbell/LogosCoin)
All users have an infinite stock of their own KarmaCoin
KarmaCoin is love based
### Object builder (and seller)
### Physical
- physics
- collisions
- multiscale voxels
### Block callback
- click callback, to do something in the game on click

### Code block
Press spacebar to enter code into a block

### Virtual Projection
(AR) Visit friends virtually.
They are in their house and you just come to visit.
### Selection Code
Select blocks, press e to open an editor for the selection. write code

### Judgements
? $$
? API calls
? Cycles
? Distance Traveled
? Lines of code written
? Lessons learned

### Actons
- Write code (all the actions)
- Move blocks
- Click on blocks

### Space

- physical 3d space of NYC
- state space of various blocks in the physical 3d space
- portals

### Building
   - Players can construct with voxel placement (ugh, another minecraft clone...)
### Factions
    - Assist the city through various factions
      - NYPD
      - NYC Community Garden Association
      - Tree Cybernetics
      - GNU

### Other

$ Players use an in game IDE to write code that influences the game world
  - Objects in the world are scriptable
  - Objects can be spawned
$ Click in and click out of windows (maybe with a button frame or hotkey)

- Move window manager around

- Subtle synchronicities that if players follow - will drastically improve their playing experience


? Enchant items with software routines
? the voxels could start out large and get progressively smaller as the player advances
? Spawn boxes/rooms for things to be drawn in
? players make agents that manipulate the environment while sleeping (or doing other things)
? Meditation to discover API endpoints for the universe
? Players can write code for items that can be equiped that can then perform actions based on the code they write
? Item enchantment with code
? Players unlock API
? Some objects are immune to API calls
? Players have API spend/rate/etc
? the source code for an object is the path the player took (placing blocks) to make it
? piece components together to build cyborgs
? AI? Maybe for the cyborgs... definitely not for the kickstarter though

V Blow stuff up with placed charges that have customizable size!
#### Freedom vs Controlled experience
- Lessons should be relatively controlled
- The world should be free



## Design Mindset
### I am building a Jewel
I have something here. I just need to add more material to the kernel
and compress it hard enough. Slow, methodical, consitent compression.

```
$ implemented
~ kindof have it
* working on
- committed
? maybe
V probably not
```

## Kickstarter
150k by Dec 31st...
  ...so 5,000 - 10,000 backers!
  20k minumum to get me through to march.
### MVDemo
- Hackwits castle
- Rendering a 2nd matrix into a framebuffer (to directly draw to screen
    (and mimick wayland))
Thats it... thats all I will need
### Video
    - Story
    - Show Mechanics
    - Show World
    - Follow interest curves (I don't know how I'll do this).
### Target Market
Cyber people
### Path
#### Approval
Just get a decent demo out

#### Success
- replicate Portland
- make avitar
- script bots to demo multiplayer
Mon, Nov 27: Submit Kickstarter for Review

### Why
I need 150k to live a full free year in Portland Oregon
    So I can:
    - read
    - meditate
    - expiriment
    - love

### What version will I launch
- Portland
- Maybe other cities
- Making this an MMO makes me think I'm in WAY over my head
- Part of me only wants to do a Hogwarts like Castle
- What if I replaced Reed with a Hogwarts like Castle
### Pitch
- HackMatrix engine
- UrbaNetica replica of Portland
- Multiplayer
- Play in our world... or design your own
- Alternative economy experiment
p.276: interest curves: 2134 (higher, more exciting)
### Perks
200$: Choose one of the 3 user selected playable cities
300$: Choose one of the 3 user selected playable cities
500$: Choose one of the 3 user selected playable cities
### Final Evaluation of the Lenses
I should do a final evaluation of lenses
to ensure that the game is most impactful
before I hit the ship button.
I can do this after I submit for review (while waiting for review)
## Interface
Minimal currently. Probably needs a bit more of something.
At least a build mode with block selection or something.
## Aesthetic
$ voxel
- portland
### colors
What if I blended man-made colors and natural colors with a sharp distinction between the two
This would capture the essense of being in a park in the midst of NYC.

Overall, I'm liking the spacemacs colors... however, it will be nice to see what the contrast between these colors and fall nature colors looks like when I get around to implementing textures like that

#### man made
* [spacemacs colors](https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme/blob/master/spacemacs-theme.el)
* all the rainbow parens in lisp

#### nature
- look at fall over the smokies


### shaders

## Limits
- Zones of Limitation
  - Building
  - Dimensions (inside buildings)
  - Use of code
  - API resources
  - Speed allowed to travel
  - ETC

The game will need limits of some kind:

- Financial
- Time
- Speed
- Resources

All of these limits could be contex bound to various challenges

### Zones of Limitation
I can implement zones or bounds of limitation on physical spaces or time space or some other dimension, where upon entering the zone, the player has to play within the limits.

This is similar to entering into a human body from the limitless realm of light/love

## App interface
- Add a frame to the app, so users can close windows
## Marketing
- Hackathons: I can host hackathons where users hang out in virtual dorm rooms

## The toy: How can the matrix be a toy?
$ place blocks
- code blocks
$ watch blocks do stuff

## Multiplayer
- community property
- occupy the same space as others
- view screens that others can view
  - if permissions
- interact with screens that others own
  - if permissions of course
- talk with others
- VRChat like muting system... etc

## Technology
$ X Window to allow IDE
  - Direct pixel rendering to keep crisp image
  - snap to flat, draw with pixels
  - hotkeys for fast window switching
$ Windows: Desktop Duplication API
$ C++
$ Python API
$ Lisp API
$ Javascript API
$ ZeroMQ
$ OpenGL

- City recreation based on google streetview (or some similar)
  - Portland
  - Using:
    - COLMAP (didn't work)
    - Mapillary
    - Probably some custom reconstruction code
    - OpenStreetMap


- Chunks will probably need to be stored in a database
- Load in minecraft buildings
- Load in magicavoxel data

- It is becomming obvious that I will need to optimize my renderer even more.

? Multiple X windows to allow a browser as well
- recompilable while playing

- run like multiple linux VMs, one that you are building in, the other that is playing the engine

## Target Audience
- people wanting to get really good at software engineering and cybernetics
- e/acc
- Elon Musk; I want Elon Musk to play this game!
- 16-35 year olds
- professional SWEs or noobs?
- creators (in general)
- intellectuals
- the esoteric

## BrainStorms
### Value multipliers
I meditated on various ideas that could achieve a 100x multiplier in Kickstarter backers
- NYC - 10x
- How to build a minecraft - 10x
- Build your own 3d desktop - 10x
- Aliens - 5x
- 3d Reddit - 100x

#### 3d reddit - 100x
    - Users can post their projects in their niche
    - Users can hang out in the space, talk, work
    - Every niche has "work" that can be experienced by others, immersively, live.
      - Meme makers use Photoshop.
      - Fashionistas browse clothing in online stores.
      - Hackers share and discuss code


### Maslows Needs
- physiological
    ?housing mechanic
    ?eating/drinking mechanic
    ?cold temps (of NYC!)
- saftey
    ?places where players can have private experiences


## Inspiration
- Mechanica
- Starcel
- Robocraft
- Plasma game
- Eragon
- Pokemon
  - The city exploration
  - The MissingNo cheat
  - The colors
  - The badges (which lined up with the show)

## World
The UrbaNetica world will be made "trans media", because people will act it out in the real world

## Characters
### Avitars
I like the idea of fully customizable avitars
    Like VRChat
### AIs that occupy a space
What did I call these years ago? Daemons... prior to that?
### Policy
The policy on characters is that users should create them
and put them into the world

## Multiplayer
### Style
- Cooperative
- Meeting up
### Voice chat
- How will players choose when to talk with someone (or have it be chosen for them?)
### Avitars
### Screen sharing
### Space sharing
### Events
### Permissions

### Guilds/houses
I want these to form naturally,
so I will build the infrastructure once
informal groups form.
## Architecture
How do I give the architecture a timeless, essential quality (way of timeless building)
- Procedurally generated buildings
- Manually generated buildings (by me)
- Precedurally replicated buildings
- Hand crafted replicated buildings
- Manually generated large iconic buildings, with other modes for non-iconics
- Trail creation via feet erosion of grass (not sure where this should be added).
- MarkovJunior buildings
- I kind of want to design a city here... like a futuristic Earth city
- Roads are smooth
### Grand Magical University
- Center of the World
- Best looking Architecture
- Many code mages
- Occult symbols
- Lots of purple

## Altered Perceptual Experiences of the Game
After recieving funding, I will create 2 altered perceptual experiences of my game.
### Cannabis (0.5-1.5g; a big dose)
### Lucy (150-200ug)

## Backstory
