# Matrix
## Goal: Launch a Kickstarter worth $150,000 on March 11th, 2024
## Schedule
### Feb 21 - Feb 25 meditation & imagination
### Feb 27 - Mar 07 build
### Mar 08 - Mar 08 submit
### Mar 11 - Mar 11 launch
## Self Contract: $150,000 exists in my venmo that I can spend freely, April 11th, signed: Collin Bell
## Questions
### Why would enough people be interested in Matrix for its Kickstarter to get $150,000 in pledges?
### What qualities and features would such a valuable product have?
### How can I develop matrix with such qualities and features, given the time, energy, and resources I have at my disposal?


## Lenses
### 1) Emotion
- Intensity
- Focus
- Fun
- Flow
- Competency
- Value for the future
- Learning
- Insight
### 2) Essential Experience
Hacker fully immersed in software
### 3) Venue
New York City
- Time Square (with buildings made of code)
- Experience Stations (with various layers of code experience and challenges)
- Corners or Villages or Shops with different specialties (algos, graphics, web, etc)
### 4) Suprise
- Bugs to be solved (with graphical insight into how the bugs arose)
- Bugs in their own code (with graphical insight as well)
- Suprise by how much the user can learn and be engaged with learning
### 5) Fun
- Blowups
- Extreme parameters
- Programmed physical experiences
### 6) Curiosity
- What crazy things can I do with code?
- Will this game make me a great engineer?
- Can it keep me engaged?
- Is it more valuable than l33tc0de
### 7) Endogenous Value
- The player will take real world skill in the game
- The game will make them fall in love with software
- They can show off solutions to friends
- They can attain high scores for solutions
- They can study with friends
### 8) Problem solving
- L33tC0de
- University Labs
- Fun minigames solved with code
- A senior project (hackathon?)
### 9) Elemental Tetrad
#### Aesthetic:
NYC
#### Mechanics:
Problem solving in game. Open world.
#### Technology:
Code in game. Tech is innovative.
#### Story:
Somewhat lacking right now
### 10) Holographic Design
The design will be holographic to both designer and user
I can have different layers or slices of the world which represent different abstractions


### 11) Unification (Theme)
Hackers + Matrix + Howels Moving Castle

### 12) Resonance
What is special about the game is a 3d, game like programming environment.
### 13) Infinite Inspiration
I want to share my NYC hacker experience with others. I can capture its essence by
putting the locations I worked, people I met, and maybe even some of the places I lived into the game (homeless shelter becomes a dorm for talented hackers. My buhdist friend becomes a mentor. BJ becomes a game boss, etc
### 14) The Problem Statement
SWE can be boring and difficult. I want to...
...immerse people in code to make SWE more fun, engaging, magical, social, and captivating.
### 15) The Eight Filters
1) Does the game feel right? No
2) Will the intended audience like this game enough? No
3) Is it a well designed game? Yes/No
4) Is the game novel enough? Yes
5) Will this game sell? No
6) Is it technically possible to build this game? Yes
7) Does this game meet our social and community goals? No
8) Do the playtesters enjoy this game enough? Yes/No (I'm the only play tester)
### 16) Risk Mitigation
Lack of  time to implement core features and give the game polish is a risk to the game.
I don't know how to stop that from happening though. I've got a deadline. I could take a job, but that would defeat the purpose.

### 17) The Toy
If my game had no goal, it would be fun. Making blocks move is fun.
However, that is just the ideal game. Right now, the game isn't super fun.
### 18) Passion
Am I filled with blinding passion with how great this game will be?
If I've lost the passion, can I find it again?
If the passion isn't comming back, shouldn't I be doing something else?
### 19) The Player
They like well polished experiences. They like to think they are maximizing value
They don't like wasting their time or money.
They expect to see something fun or educational that really helps them in life.
If I were in their place, I would want an engaging multiplayer learning experience.
They will dislike how unpolished the game is and how uncohesive the coding problems are.

Perhaps, instead of putting myself in a venue first, I should put myself inside the Tron matrix of pure abstract digital imaginings (*sigh*)

What if I seperated the dynamic object space from the chunked environment space!!!
### 20) Pleasure
It gives them pleasure in understanding
It may feel too much like work though, especially if it isn't multiplayer
### 21) Flow
Theoretically, my game has goals and are the same as the player.
The goal being to get good at programming, practice, have fun doing it, maybe show off.
My game has yet to have any implented challenges though, so specifics are fuzzy
### 22) Needs
My game operates on the highest of Maslows needs. It doesn't fullfill basic needs.
It could fulfil love to a degree if it is made into a multiplayer game.
### 23) Motivation*
Players will want to play my game because they can practice their code skills in a fun way.
The most internal motivation is that players want to succeed in their career. The most external motivation is that players will be tired of "work" but still want to not be lazy in their free time.
Some pleasure seeking motivations is that players will want to "enter the matrix" or be in "Tron"
I think most of the motivations support each other. The lazy motivation may not be super conducive to actual learning though.
### 24) Novelty
Coding in game on a real IDE is novel
The primary game mechanic is novel
Minecraft is familiar, puzzle adventures are familiar
The game's novelty is present not for novelty sake, so yes, the game will be good
even once the novelty wears off
### 25) Judgement
My game judges the ability of their code to solve the problem.
It communicates the judgement by the objects in the world solving the challenge and doing what they are supposed to.
The players will feel the judgement is fair, because it is objective. Either the code solves the problem or doesn't. Some advanced players will feel that it is slightly unfair to them because they will want to use clean code and other players may want to use dirty code. I can impove fairness by building upon past code such that cleanliness matters.
Players will care about the judgement because it will be connected to many of the indogenous values about the game.
The judgement will make the players want to improve, both in the game and in the real world (which presumably is one reason they are playing the game).
### 26) Funcitonal Space
The space is continuous, in 3 dimensions, currently no boundaries, but will have building boudaries, many sub spaces connected like a city (maybe with magic portals as well).
### 27) Time
What determines the length of the gameplay activities?
The modularity of the challenges. How chunked down the challenges are determines time quanta.
Are players frustrated because the game ends to early, bored because it takes too long?
If I have a plotline, I will probably end too early.
If I don't have a plotline, the game may be near infinite, but the challenges themselves won't be. Obv I'll need a plotline of some kind.

Should I set a game timelimit?
That might be a good idea for speed runners. Would make the game like l33tc0de

Would a hierarchy of time help structure my game?
For sure. Writing code is all about time chunking.

### 28) State Machine
I have static and dynamic objects
Objects can have any programmable attribute given the nature of the game
The possible states are any state the level designer or player can think up
Anything can trigger state changes
### 29) Secrets
Some puzzles will have solutions that only the game will know as being correct.
There also may be some API surface that is unknown to the players.
Players will know much of the API surface though.
Few things will be known by only 1 player (although challenges can be randomized so solutions only apply to 1 player)
Not sure if concealing or revealing more information will improve the experience
### 30) Emergence
How many verbs do my players have?
How many objects can each verb act on?
How many ways can players achieve their goals?
How many subjects do the players control?
How do side effects change constraints?
### 31) Action
What are the basic actions of my game?
- Writing code
- Running code
- All the API function calls available in the library
    - move()

What are the strategic actions?
- High level functions that the user creates for themselves.
- I suppose we could provide some high level strategic functions as well.
### 32) Goals
What is the ultimate goal of my game?
Build people into better programmers who enjoy the art of software.

Is that goal clear to players?
It will be

Are my goals concrete?
No, but I can add achievements and scoreboard and such
### 33) Rules
Each mission will have their own seperate ruleset
Of course, algorithmic rules are going to be unbreakable
Language rules will be unbreakable
The compiler enforces the rules
Except for the missions, which will have code enforcement
### 34) Skill
What skills are required:
- Software eng
- problem solving
### 35) Expected Value
There isn't much randomness to this game.
It is all algorthimic playing.
### 36) Chance
My game currently does not have randomness.
I literally haven't used a random number generator at all.
### 37) Fairness
The game right now is symmetrical, but it might be interesting to do game scaling
so that players who are advanced don't have to do a boring intro and players who are beginers aren't overwhelmed at the beginning
### 38) Challenge
The lense of challenge seems like the lens of problem solving
except difficulties are evaluated.
### 39) Choices
I don't know what choices the user will make besides what code to write.
### 40) Triangularity
Give a low risk low reward, high risk high reward option
### 41) Skill vs Chance
My game is a serious game. The players are here to be judged. Coding is tedious, but is important and so the game is meant to prime their brains to find enjoyment from it.
I could add randomness to some of the challenges to make them more fun.
### 42) Head and Hands
The primary game mechanic, being coding, is primarily head oriented.
I could include VIM games to make muscle memory be a factor
I could also make traveling be a component to give players and intellectual break
### 43) Competition
Unless I add multiplayer, there will be no competition
### 44) Cooperation
There will be no cooperation if there is no multiplayer
## Idea
Possible pitch ideas
- Learn data structures
- Learn how to build a minecraft world
- LearnOpenGL
- Just a multiplayer desktop app
## VR
This should support VR out of the box. I want a VR desktop and I will have it.
I will buy a XR headset when I'm in STL and implement XR controls before I leave.
## Kickstarter
### Idea (I need to focus on these 4 things to make the 150,000$)
I should really focus on this lens
#### a good idea
- an immersive coding tutorial?
#### in the right place: here
VR, digital world, english speaking
#### at the right time: now
2024, XR has a flagship headset, VRChat is the largest multiplyer VR
VR is used for fun (mostly), no one works full time in it, it isn't used for schooling,
online universities suck
#### sold convincingly
If I can get a social media influencer to team up with me, then it can be sold convincingly
### Be Passionate
I need to be passionate about the game to sell it.
This means I must:
    - love the game
    - be excited about its future
    - have commitment, drive, and determination to deliver a quality product
### Goal
150k, so I can move to Oregon and be free for 2 years
(which will init the rest of my life)
    - read
    - meditate
    - expiriment
    - love
    - build my cybernetics corporation

### Units Sold
To hit the goal, I would need 5000-10000 backers!
... or better perks than just a 15-30$ game sale
### Plan
12 hour hack days until I get the money
### The Play
Show my values.
Show how I've incorporated my values into HackMatrix.
Show how I will incorporate my values into the finished product.
Be authentic and sell from that position.
This is a sales play. If I make the sale, the product will follow.
Promise the world and then I will deliver. I can do this.
### MVDemo
- HackMatrix castle
- Rendering a 2nd matrix into a framebuffer (to directly draw to screen
    (and mimick wayland))
- Processes as owls
Thats it... thats all I will need
### Video
    - Story
    - Show Mechanics
    - Show World
    - Follow interest curves (I don't know how I'll do this).

### Perks
To be honest, I don't know how to create differentiated perks
### Final Evaluation of the Lenses
I should do a final evaluation of lenses
to ensure that the game is most impactful
before I hit the ship button.
I can do this after I submit for review (while waiting for review)


## Design Mindset
### I am building a Jewel
I have something here. I just need to add more material to the kernel
and compress it hard enough. Slow, methodical, consitent compression.

Have no fear in this approach... just keep it up

## Mechanic
- Coding Education
- Conceptual excercises and quests based on structures
  and algorithms needed to build the 3d desktop environment
- Or to build minecraft clone
- Or to learn opengl
- Or to learn/practice data structures
## What I love about the game
### What do I love about v1?
- The game will allow me to give love!
- Objects can be scripted in game
- Matrix will eventually work on Vision Pro
- Its venue is NYC
- It will work with PCVR, so I can work in VR flawlessly
- It is the first software creation of mine that has recieved 100k views and 10k likes.
- It replaces my desktop environment
- It is written in C++
- I understand how it works
- It will evolve to help me with robotics
- It is the first product I've worked on since discovering communication with God
- It is my last stand. That this is the product I have decided will succeed.
- This will be my first significant success
- It is the first 3d program I have written to completion

## Why would players want the game?
## Playtesting
### Pre-Kickstarter
- Go to Knox Makerspace on Jan 2nd or Jan 9th (if mother and Jeff are out of the house)
### Post-Kickstarter, Pre-delivery
- Go to maker spaces or tech conferences
## Altered Perceptual Experiences of the Game
After recieving funding, I will create 2 altered perceptual experiences of my game.
### Cannabis (0.5-1.5g; a big dose)
### Lucy (150-200ug)

## Multiplayer
### Style
- Cooperative
- Meeting up
### Voice chat
- How will players choose when to talk with someone (or have it be chosen for them?)
### Avitars
### Screen sharing
### Space sharing
### Events
### Permissions

### Guilds/houses
I want these to form naturally,
so I will build the infrastructure once
informal groups form.
## Events
- HackMatrix opening ceremony?
## What are things that have the highest value to the backer
- A high quality place (HackMatrix castle)
- Multiplayer (to be implemented)
- A desire to use the system
## TODO
- get castle loaded
- fix performance issues
- create video
- create perks
## What do I love about Gianetica
- It brings computing into the physical and social realm
- It gives people mental power
- It will help me to love software engineering and cybernetics development
- I will be able to connect better with others
- I built it
- It is a 3d linux system
- It will immerse people and connect them
- It will make computing free again (in the VR era)
- It is written in C++
## Audio
I really need to think about audio
I want to introduce the world to trance music and would love to include all trance songs
, but I don't think I could get that many liscenses.

Maybe I should just natively support spotify so people can use their own music
## Purpose
Immerse people in their projects by making them feel like they are in a magical fiction novel while doing their work

Show the love of God

Commune with others while working on thier projects from anywhere in the world
## Game Theme
- Living in a crystal city filled with cybernetic organisms
- Divine/magical power and hormony
     beyond one's comprehension
   is available to those who seek it
       and learn to harmonize themselves
           with the spirit of Wralda
              and the love of other free people
## Questions that arise from the purpose
### What are the problems with current methods of immersion?

#### Lack of social connection
I grew up in a semi-rural suburban area with few hackers.

I didn't have many hacker friends or many friends with similar interests.

Most of my work has been done alone.

The best and most productive times of my life
have been when I have worked with others
in fully immersive hackathon like experiences.

The current desktop experience is largely isolating and a solitary endevour.

If I make the experience into a multi-player game, then it would be more fun!

#### Having the code editor so decoupled from the application is lame.
I want to be able to edit my game in my game. HackMatrix allows me to do that.

### How does it go about doing this?
Embeds the hacker in a 3d hacker environment


## Development
### Process
- Attack and keep attacking
- Conciousness reset. (raise above, every day, each week)
### Tickets
- $Fix block placement outside of first chunk
- Get multi chunk scrolling working
- Fix level saving (probably negative coordinates issue)
### Milestones
#### Pre kickstarter
- 10 cities in voxels (maybe it is better just to use one city?) (maybe not)
  - Chunking
  - Elevations
  - Map to street
  - Smooth elevation changes (for streets)
- 1 demo in each of the lesson categories

#### Maybes

- Robots
- Choose IDE level
- 3 challenges
  $ path finding algo, with sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W8hNdEUFbc
  - neural network with visualization: https://github.com/wmvanvliet/scns/tree/main/visualizations/multilayer_perceptron & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsvxx-GGlTg
  - cellular automata: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQJ5aEsP6Fs

- Fully functioning windows (right clicks)
- Ability to open and close arbitrary programs (fully functioning WM)
- Window highlight

- 3 enchant objects in your environment
  - Open a video when you click on a fictional character
  - Make a voxel follow you.
  - Make voxel shoot you when you try to go on twitter.

- Cyberpunk castle
  - art gallery
- 3 coding utlities
- Fake multiplayer (or some shit)


#### Path
   - Meshing
   - World Building
     - Buildings
     - Plants/Parks
   - Mechanics
   - Levels
   - Finishing Touches
   - Marketing Materials
   - Launch

### Process
- Simply make the best game I can
- Use short-wave intervals (per commit basis)
- Keep polishing and compressing it like a diamond
       - like how Mickey Singer viewed his medical manager code
- Modulate the time I spend doing various tasks in the short-wave
       - do important tasks (matrix/phoenix infode improvements longer)

### Momentum
- Working on this game is draining, even with faith
- I will keep short-wave momentum up until plans for achieving better momentum are transfered from infinite intelligence
- Every day, no exception
## Story
We collectively transformed it with our digital imaginings.
They called it a video game, but we called it our future and then made it so.
How else was a complex city supposed to be planned?... in meatspace?
No, first we created it in our collective digital mind, then in reality
We simulated the city of our wildest dreams:
  With alternate economies,
    improved poltical systems,
      and harmonious relationships

  Now we live there and this is our history:
    Welcome to the City of Cybernetics!
### missions

- Perhaps, I could structure the game by class, where each class is itself a game!
- Users must write a computer program that solves problems in the environment.
- Students learn by doing side quests that teach them the concepts required for OS work

Example:
- Users must draw an image to their screen and take a picture of it. Neural networks will analyze that the image is accurate

? Get a food delivery to a person on time: Upload a map to a robot and have it use the map to navigate to the correct location. Or just have it sort things out without a map entirely, just using cardinal directions or something... or street numbers.

### questions
- what choices must the player make?
- how will those choices effect the experience?
### game story types and their potential for City of Cybernetics
#### strings and pearls
##### what
cut scene -> level -> cutscene -> level
##### potential in City of Cybernetics
#### story generator
sims or roller coaster tycoon, "no author"
I might want to add sims elements to my game

- HackMatrix: Agent
- HackMatrix: Inception

### Social Media
- Reddit... 3d room form?


## Mechanics
### Cybernetics
- The game objects (not the environment) occupy a voxel space that is 100x smaller
  than the environment.
- Or, maybe I can use pre-existing cad software and seamlessly yeet the models into the game
### Economics:
    Ownership, both communal and private

    Logos Coin

    By the year 2030,
    The City of Cybernetics produces
    a municipal  revenue
    higher than any other city,
    which allows it to povide a Universal Basic Income
    that is equivalent to a 2020's high end STEM salary

    The UBI is generated by its large stock ownership
    in The Tree of Life Cybernetics Corp which acts as
    a utility corporation to help citizens produce cybernetics
    which they use internally to run the city, as well as export to other
    municipalities.
    
#### KarmaCoin
Since all goods are reproducible, the primary currency in game is [KarmaCoin](https://github.com/collinalexbell/LogosCoin)
All users have an infinite stock of their own KarmaCoin
KarmaCoin is love based
### Object builder (and seller)
### Physical
- physics
- collisions
- multiscale voxels
### Block callback

? Distance Traveled
? Lines of code written
? Lessons learned

### Actons
- Write code (all the actions)
- Move blocks
- Click on blocks

### Space

- physical 3d space of NYC
- state space of various blocks in the physical 3d space

##### Written in code
### Other

$ Players use an in game IDE to write code that influences the game world
  - Objects in the world are scriptable
  - Objects can be spawned
$ Click in and click out of windows (maybe with a button frame or hotkey)

- Move window manager around

- Subtle synchronicities that if players follow - will drastically improve their playing experience


? Enchant items with software routines
? the voxels could start out large and get progressively smaller as the player advances
? Spawn boxes/rooms for things to be drawn in
? players make agents that manipulate the environment while sleeping (or doing other things)
? Meditation to discover API endpoints for the universe
? Players can write code for items that can be equiped that can then perform actions based on the code they write
? Item enchantment with code
? Players unlock API
? Some objects are immune to API calls
? Players have API spend/rate/etc
? the source code for an object is the path the player took (placing blocks) to make it
? piece components together to build cyborgs
? AI? Maybe for the cyborgs... definitely not for the kickstarter though

V Blow stuff up with placed charges that have customizable size!
#### Freedom vs Controlled experience
- Lessons should be relatively controlled
- The world should be free



## Interface
Minimal currently. Probably needs a bit more of something.
At least a build mode with block selection or something.
## Aesthetic
I don't know if I want it to play or look like Minecraft. It feels to samesy
$ voxel
### colors
What if I blended man-made colors and natural colors with a sharp distinction between the two
This would capture the essense of being in a park in the midst of NYC.

Overall, I'm liking the spacemacs colors... however, it will be nice to see what the contrast between these colors and fall nature colors looks like when I get around to implementing textures like that

#### man made
* [spacemacs colors](https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme/blob/master/spacemacs-theme.el)
* all the rainbow parens in lisp

#### nature
- look at fall over the smokies


### shaders

## Limits
- Zones of Limitation
  - Building
  - Dimensions (inside buildings)
  - Use of code
  - API resources
  - Speed allowed to travel
  - ETC

The game will need limits of some kind:

- Financial
- Time
- Speed
- Resources

All of these limits could be contex bound to various challenges

### Zones of Limitation
I can implement zones or bounds of limitation on physical spaces or time space or some other dimension, where upon entering the zone, the player has to play within the limits.

This is similar to entering into a human body from the limitless realm of light/love

## App interface
- Add a frame to the app, so users can close windows
## Marketing
- Hackathons: I can host hackathons where users hang out in virtual dorm rooms

## The toy: How can the matrix be a toy?
$ place blocks
- code blocks
$ watch blocks do stuff

## Multiplayer
- community property
- occupy the same space as others
- view screens that others can view
  - if permissions
- interact with screens that others own
  - if permissions of course
- talk with others
- VRChat like muting system... etc
### Griefing strategy
- Make worlds mostly uneditable.
- AI screen sharing NSFW detection combined with user reporting
- Connect real world social media to the world (to prevent anonymous griefing)

## Technology
$ X Window to allow IDE
  - Direct pixel rendering to keep crisp image
  - snap to flat, draw with pixels
  - hotkeys for fast window switching
$ Windows: Desktop Duplication API
$ C++
$ Python API
$ Lisp API
$ Javascript API
$ ZeroMQ
$ OpenGL

- City recreation based on google streetview (or some similar)
  - Using:
    - COLMAP (didn't work)
    - Mapillary
    - Probably some custom reconstruction code
    - OpenStreetMap


- Chunks will probably need to be stored in a database
- Load in minecraft buildings
- Load in magicavoxel data

- It is becomming obvious that I will need to optimize my renderer even more.

? Multiple X windows to allow a browser as well
- recompilable while playing

- run like multiple linux VMs, one that you are building in, the other that is playing the engine

## Target Audience
- people wanting to get really good at software engineering and cybernetics
- e/acc
- Elon Musk; I want Elon Musk to play this game!
- 16-35 year olds
- professional SWEs or noobs?
- creators (in general)
- intellectuals
- the esoteric

## BrainStorms
### Value multipliers
I meditated on various ideas that could achieve a 100x multiplier in Kickstarter backers
- NYC - 10x
- How to build a minecraft - 10x
- Build your own 3d desktop - 10x
- Aliens - 5x
- 3d Reddit - 100x

#### 3d reddit - 100x
    - Users can post their projects in their niche
    - Users can hang out in the space, talk, work
    - Every niche has "work" that can be experienced by others, immersively, live.
      - Meme makers use Photoshop.
      - Fashionistas browse clothing in online stores.
      - Hackers share and discuss code


### Maslows Needs
- physiological
    ?housing mechanic
    ?eating/drinking mechanic
    ?cold temps (of NYC!)
- saftey
    ?places where players can have private experiences


## Inspiration
- Mechanica
- Starcel
- Robocraft
- Plasma game
- Eragon
- Pokemon
  - The city exploration
  - The MissingNo cheat
  - The colors
  - The badges (which lined up with the show)

## World
The UrbaNetica world will be made "trans media", because people will act it out in the real world

## Characters
### Avitars
I like the idea of fully customizable avitars
    Like VRChat
### AIs that occupy a space
What did I call these years ago? Daemons... prior to that?
### Policy
The policy on characters is that users should create them
and put them into the world

## Architecture
How do I give the architecture a timeless, essential quality (way of timeless building)
- Procedurally generated buildings
- Manually generated buildings (by me)
- Precedurally replicated buildings
- Hand crafted replicated buildings
- Manually generated large iconic buildings, with other modes for non-iconics
- Trail creation via feet erosion of grass (not sure where this should be added).
- MarkovJunior buildings
- I kind of want to design a city here... like a futuristic Earth city
- Roads are smooth
### Grand Magical University
- Center of the World
- Best looking Architecture
- Many code mages
- Occult symbols
- Lots of purple

## Backstory

## Retrospective
- Doing this alone is MEGA painful

## AI
The game will have AI at some point in some way
The matrix was concieved as a place to train AIs
Right now though, this is not foundational to the experience
