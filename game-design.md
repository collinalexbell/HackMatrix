# HackMatrix

## Purpose
Immerse hackers in their projects

### What are the problems with current methods of immersion?

#### Lack of social connection
I grew up in a semi-rural suburban area with few hackers.

I didn't have many hacker friends or many friends with similar interests.

Most of my work has been done alone.

The best and most productive times of my life
have been when I have worked with others
in fully immersive hackathon like experiences.

The current desktop experience is largely isolating and a solitary endevour.

If I make the experience into a multi-player game, then it would be more fun!

### How does it go about doing this?
Embeds the hacker in a 3d hacker environment

## Kickstarter
### Goal
150k

...so 5,000 - 10,000 backers!

### Path
Mon, Nov 27: Submit Kickstarter for Review

### Why
I need 150k to live a full free year in Portland Oregon
    So I can:
    - read
    - meditate
    - expiriment
    - love

Every person who buys this gets:
0) HackMatrix beta with full source code, released 12-23-23
1) HackMatrix alpha,                      released 12-23-24

### What version will I launch
- SICP: has viral popularity, but too esoteric and involved for v0
- OpenGL: everyone wants to build a video game, but game engines are tough
- Introduction to \<xLang\>: Could be useful, especially if I can find a good xLang book to model fun games after


## Design Mindset
### I am building a Jewel
- fundamentally this means that bugs and stability come before features

```
$ implemented
~ kindof have it
* working on
- committed
? maybe
V probably not
```

## Pitch

- "bring your own IDE"
  - Show character walking up to the editors and then hopping between them
  - Make it look like they are selecting between pokemon in a lab or something

- "Solve 3d challenges in your favorite language"

- "Enchant objects"

- "Build your environment" # This seems too minecrafty
  Manually:
    - Click click click
  Or with code:
    - Open editor, run

- "Imerse yourself in your projects"
  - Show off cool 3d coding utilities

- "Hack with friends"

- "Pratice core CS concepts"



## Development Milestones
(I'm partially hoping that YC saves the day, I'm way behind on deadlines)

- Choose IDE level
- 3 challenges
  $ path finding algo, with sound: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W8hNdEUFbc
  - neural network with visualization: https://github.com/wmvanvliet/scns/tree/main/visualizations/multilayer_perceptron & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tsvxx-GGlTg
  - cellular automata: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQJ5aEsP6Fs

- Fully functioning windows (right clicks)
- Ability to open and close arbitrary programs (fully functioning WM)

- 3 enchant objects in your environment
  - Open a video when you click on a fictional character
  - Make a voxel follow you.
  - Make voxel shoot you when you try to go on twitter.

- Cyberpunk castle
  - art gallery
- 3 coding utlities
- Fake multiplayer (or some shit)

### Path
   - Meshing
   - World Building
     - Buildings
     - Plants/Parks
   - Mechanics
   - Levels
   - Finishing Touches
   - Marketing Materials
   - Launch

## Marketing
- Hackathons: I can host hackathons where users hang out in virtual dorm rooms

## process
- Simply make the best game I can
- Keep polishing and compressing it like a diamond
       - like how Mickey Singer viewed his medical manager code
- Modulate the time I spend doing various tasks in the short-wave
       - do important tasks (matrix/phoenix infode improvements longer)

## The toy: How can the matrix be a toy?
$ place blocks
- code blocks
$ watch blocks do stuff

## essential experience
- concious hackers of their own world and become fully enlightened technokings
- gamify software learning


## Game Theme
- Living in a crystal city filled with cybernetic organisms
- Divine/magical power beyond one's comprehension
  is available to those who seek it
  and learn to harmonize themselves
  with the spirit of the universe



## aesthetic
$ voxel
$ tron

- put yourself in the view of other creatures
~ custom shaders for blocks!!!!

? what size voxels
? how will I generate the textures

V 3rd person

### colors
What if I blended man-made colors and natural colors with a sharp distinction between the two
This would capture the essense of being in a park in the midst of NYC.

Overall, I'm liking the spacemacs colors... however, it will be nice to see what the contrast between these colors and fall nature colors looks like when I get around to implementing textures like that

#### man made
* [spacemacs colors](https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme/blob/master/spacemacs-theme.el)
* all the rainbow parens in lisp

#### nature
- look at fall over the smokies


### architecture

- I kind of want to design a city here... like a futuristic Earth city

MarkovJunior buildings

- New York City! End of Story!
  - Players could occupy my apartment studio virtually
- Voxel NYC! (Seems like a challenge, but eh, w.e)

? trees, lots of trees
? clasical buildings with futurist twist
? well designed city blocks (like savanah, good for trees)

? greek
? cyber-greek
? nyc style
? colonial
? steam punk
? savanah georgia

### shaders
crt: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Ms23DR
outlined voxels: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PeYSrakvCw



## mechanics

code tools, like spells

## multiplayer
- occupy the same space as others
- view screens that others can view
  - if permissions
- interact with screens that others own
  - if permissions of course


## physical
- physics
- collisions
- multiscale voxels

### Block callback
- click callback, to do something in the game on click

### Code block
Press spacebar to enter code into a block

### Selection Code
Select blocks, press e to open an editor for the selection. write code

### Judgements
? $$
? API calls
? Cycles
? Distance Traveled
? Lines of code written
? Lessons learned

### Actons
- Write code (all the actions)
- Move blocks
- Click on blocks

### Space

- physical 3d space of NYC
- state space of various blocks in the physical 3d space
- portals

### Building
   - Players can construct with voxel placement (ugh, another minecraft clone...)

### Factions
    - Assist the city through various factions
      - NYPD
      - NYC Community Garden Association
      - Tree Cybernetics
      - GNU

### Other

$ Players use an in game IDE to write code that influences the game world
  - Objects in the world are scriptable
  - Objects can be spawned
$ Click in and click out of windows (maybe with a button frame or hotkey)

- Subtle synchronicities that if players follow - will drastically improve their playing experience


? Enchant items with software routines
? the voxels could start out large and get progressively smaller as the player advances
? Spawn boxes/rooms for things to be drawn in
? players make agents that manipulate the environment while sleeping (or doing other things)
? Meditation to discover API endpoints for the universe
? Players can write code for items that can be equiped that can then perform actions based on the code they write
? Item enchantment with code
? Players unlock API
? Some objects are immune to API calls
? Players have API spend/rate/etc
? the source code for an object is the path the player took (placing blocks) to make it
? piece components together to build cyborgs

V Blow stuff up with placed charges that have customizable size!

## tokens

- earn tokens to make API calls, these tokens can be specific types of manna or something else.

## puzzles

- [Turret Avoidance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY6jR52fFWo)
- Create a trajectory to shoot a ball through the hoop


## Story
- VR Hogwartz for hackers
- While exploring a lost city, a <x>th century player discovers a strange glowing apple growing on a tree.
  When the apple is picked up, it expands into a pair of goggles that the player puts on.
  Instantly, screens can be placed anywhere in the world and the source code of the world is visible, thus enabling the player
  to manipulate matter, if only he can find the right Names of Power.

  The player comes across a magician:

  (rewrite for the sake of the game " We are about to study the idea of a computational process. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer[matrix] with our spells.

  A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.

  A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. Thus, like the sorcerer's apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. Even small errors (usually called bugs or glitches) in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences.")

### missions

- Perhaps, I could structure the game by class, where each class is itself a game!
- Users must write a computer program that solves problems in the environment.
- Students learn by doing side quests that teach them the concepts required for OS work

Example:
- Users must draw an image to their screen and take a picture of it. Neural networks will analyze that the image is accurate

? Get a food delivery to a person on time: Upload a map to a robot and have it use the map to navigate to the correct location. Or just have it sort things out without a map entirely, just using cardinal directions or something... or street numbers.

## technology
$ X Window to allow IDE
  - Direct pixel rendering to keep crisp image
  - snap to flat, draw with pixels
  - hotkeys for fast window switching
$ C++
$ Python API
$ Lisp API
$ Javascript API
$ ZeroMQ
$ OpenGL

? City recreation based on google streetview (or some similar) - This is starting to seem like a better idea...
? Multiple X windows to allow a browser as well
- recompilable while playing

- run like multiple linux VMs, one that you are building in, the other that is playing the engine

## target audience
- people wanting to get really good at software engineering and cybernetics
- e/acc
- Elon Musk; I want Elon Musk to play this game!
- 16-35 year olds
- professional SWEs or noobs?


## Maslows needs
- physiological
    ?housing mechanic
    ?eating/drinking mechanic
    ?cold temps (of NYC!)
- saftey
    ?places where players can have private experiences


## Funding milestones
- Multiplayer
-


## Freedom vs Controlled experience
- Lessons should be relatively controlled
- The world should be free


## Brainstormed value multipliers
I meditated on various ideas that could achieve a 100x multiplier in Kickstarter backers
- NYC - 10x
- How to build a minecraft - 10x
- Build your own 3d desktop - 10x
- Aliens - 5x
- 3d Reddit - 100x
