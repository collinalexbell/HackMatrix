# Simulation Theory (working title)

```
$ implemented
~ kindof have it
* working on
- committed
? maybe
V probably not
```

## process
- Simply make the best game I can
- Keep polishing and compressing it like a diamond
       - like how Mickey Singer viewed his medical manager code
- Modulate the time I spend doing various tasks in the short-wave
       - do important tasks (matrix/phoenix infode improvements longer)

## next up
- face highlighting or reticle (so I know where I'm building)

## after that

## path to MVP
- (defun ready? (game)
         (answers-all-the-questions-appropriately game))

- make a list of KeyResults that would allow this software to earn 4k
- make a list of KeyResults that would allow this software to earn 150k
- make a list of KeyResults that would allow this software to get funding from YC
- implement the features 1 by 1
- iterate on game design on each short wave
- post the game every so often to determine how popular it will be (and to gain a following)

## the questions
- Will this software make me 150k?
- Will this software make me 4k so I can go to Florida & Oregon with my dog and pay off storage fees?
- Will this software allow me to get funding from YC?
- Am I proud of this software?

## KeyResults
- 150k
  - 15,000 @ 10$ or 3,000 @ 50$
- 4k
  - 400 @ 10$ or 80 @ 50$
- YC funding
  - Users
  - Revenue


## The toy: How can the matrix be a toy?
- place blocks
- code blocks
- watch blocks do stuff

## essential experience
- concious hackers of their own world and become fully enlightened technokings
- gamify software learning


## Game Theme
- living in a city filled with cybernetic organisms

? Divine/magical power beyond one's comprehension
  is available to those who seek it
  and learn to harmonize themselves
  with the spirit of the universe

? diy ethic
V solar cyborgs
V automated homestead life
V exploring an ancient world that contains cyberenetic artifacts


## aesthetic
$ voxel
$ shader over unfocused X11 app
$ tron

~ custom shaders for blocks!!!!

? what size voxels
? how will I generate the textures

V 3rd person

### colors
What if I blended man-made colors and natural colors with a sharp distinction between the two
This would capture the essense of being in a park in the midst of NYC.

Overall, I'm liking the spacemacs colors... however, it will be nice to see what the contrast between these colors and fall nature colors looks like when I get around to implementing textures like that

#### man made
* [spacemacs colors](https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme/blob/master/spacemacs-theme.el)
* all the rainbow parens in lisp

#### nature
- look at fall over the smokies


### architecture
- New York City! End of Story!
- Voxel NYC! (Seems like a challenge, but eh, w.e)
? Textures from the city?

? trees, lots of trees
? clasical buildings with futurist twist
? well designed city blocks (like savanah, good for trees)

? greek
? cyber-greek
? nyc style
? colonial
? steam punk
? savanah georgia

### shaders

outlined voxels: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PeYSrakvCw



## mechanics
- physics
- collisions

### Block callback
- click callback, to do something in the game on click

### Code block
Press spacebar to enter code into a block

### Judgements
? $$
? API calls
? Cycles
? Distance Traveled
? Lines of code written
? Lessons learned

### Actons
- Write code (all the actions)
- Move blocks
- Click on blocks

### Space

- physical 3d space of NYC
- state space of various blocks in the physical 3d space
- portals

### Building
   - Players can construct with voxel placement (ugh, another minecraft clone...)

### Other

$ Players use an in game IDE to write code that influences the game world
  - Objects in the world are scriptable
  - Objects can be spawned
$ Click in and click out of windows (maybe with a button frame or hotkey)

- Subtle synchronicities that if players follow - will drastically improve their playing experience


? Enchant items with software routines
? the voxels could start out large and get progressively smaller as the player advances
? Spawn boxes/rooms for things to be drawn in
? players make agents that manipulate the environment while sleeping (or doing other things)
? Meditation to discover API endpoints for the universe
? Players can write code for items that can be equiped that can then perform actions based on the code they write
? Item enchantment with code
? Players unlock API
? Some objects are immune to API calls
? Players have API spend/rate/etc
? the source code for an object is the path the player took (placing blocks) to make it
? piece components together to build cyborgs

V Blow stuff up with placed charges that have customizable size!

## tokens

- earn tokens to make API calls, these tokens can be specific types of manna or something else.

## puzzles

- [Turret Avoidance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY6jR52fFWo)
- Create a trajectory to shoot a ball through the hoop



## story


- The Gibson should feature into the game (haha)

- You build an operating system while in the game. It just like teaches you everything to build an operating system in game. WTF ahahahah!!

- Or it would be fun to use the game as a teaching tool or virtual digital classroom to teach various computer programming topics (one of which in the end game can be a full fucking operating system).

- While exploring a lost city, a <x>th century player discovers a strange glowing apple growing on a tree.
  When the apple is picked up, it expands into a pair of goggles that the player puts on.
  Instantly, screens can be placed anywhere in the world and the source code of the world is visible, thus enabling the player
  to manipulate matter, if only he can find the right Names of Power.

  The player comes across a magician:

  (rewrite for the sake of the game " We are about to study the idea of a computational process. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer[matrix] with our spells.

  A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.

  A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. Thus, like the sorcerer's apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. Even small errors (usually called bugs or glitches) in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences.")

### missions

? Get a food delivery to a person on time: Upload a map to a robot and have it use the map to navigate to the correct location. Or just have it sort things out without a map entirely, just using cardinal directions or something... or street numbers.

## technology
$ X Window to allow IDE
  - Direct pixel rendering to keep crisp image
  - snap to flat, draw with pixels
- micro voxel
$ C++
- Python API
$ Lisp API
$ ZeroMQ
$ OpenGL

? City recreation based on google streetview (or some similar) - This is starting to seem like a better idea...
? Multiple X windows to allow a browser as well
- recompilable while playing

- run like multiple linux VMs, one that you are building in, the other that is playing the engine

## target audience
- e/acc
- Elon Musk; I want Elon Musk to play this game!
- 16-35 year olds


## Maslows needs
- physiological
    ?housing mechanic
    ?eating/drinking mechanic
    ?cold temps (of NYC!)
- saftey
    ?places where players can have private experiences
