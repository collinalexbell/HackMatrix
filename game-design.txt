# matrix game design

- voxel
- 3rd person


## mechanics
? the source code for an object is the path the player took (placing blocks) to make it
- objects in the world are scriptable

? the voxels could start out large and get progressively smaller as the player advances


## story

While exploring a lost city, a <x>th century player discovers a strange glowing apple growing on a tree.
When the apple is picked up, it expands into a pair of goggles that the player puts on.
Instantly, screens can be placed anywhere in the world and the source code of the world is visible, thus enabling the player
to manipulate matter, if only he can find the right Names of Power.
