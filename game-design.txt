# Simulation Theory

```
$ implemented
* working on
- committed
? maybe
```

## process
- Simply make the best game I can
- Keep polishing and compressing it like a diamond, like how Mickey Singer viewed his medical manager code

## next up
- implement block placement
  - ray casting or something

## after that
- reanalyze what I can do to get an MVP out.
- I may need to drastically rethink my Phoenix workflow to *!CRUNCH!*


## the toy

How can the matrix be a toy?
- place blocks
- code blocks
- watch blocks do stuff

## essential experience
concious hackers of their own world
         - The Gibson should feature into the game (haha)
become fully enlightened technokings


## Game Theme

- Divine/magical power beyond one's comprehension
  is available to those who seek it
  and learn to harmonize themselves
  with the spirit of the universe

? solar cyborgs
? living in a city filled with cybernetic organisms
? diy ethic
? automated homestead life
? exploring an ancient world that contains cyberenetic artifacts


## aesthetic
* voxel
* shader over unfocused X11 app
? what size voxels
? how will I generate the textures
? 3rd person
? IDK, IDK, IDK
? tron
? custom shaders for blocks!!!!

### colors
What if I blended man-made colors and natural colors with a sharp distinction between the two
This would capture the essense of being in a park in the midst of NYC.

Overall, I'm liking the spacemacs colors... however, it will be nice to see what the contrast between these colors and fall nature colors looks like when I get around to implementing textures like that

#### man made
* [spacemacs colors](https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme/blob/master/spacemacs-theme.el)
* all the rainbow parens in lisp

#### nature
- look at fall over the smokies


### architecture
New York City! End of Story!
Voxel NYC! (Seems like a challenge, but eh, w.e)
Textures from the city?

? trees, lots of trees
? clasical buildings with futurist twist
? well designed city blocks (like savanah, good for trees)

? greek
? cyber-greek
? nyc style
? colonial
? steam punk
? savanah georgia

### shaders

## mechanics

### Block callback
- click callback, to do something in the game on click

### Judgements
- $$
- API calls
- Cycles


### Space

- physical 3d space of NYC
- state space of various blocks in the physical 3d space
- portals

### Building
   - Players can construct with voxel placement (ugh, another minecraft clone...)

### Other

$ Players use an in game IDE to write code that influences the game world
  - Objects in the world are scriptable
  - Objects can be spawned
$ Click in and click out of windows (maybe with a button frame or hotkey)

? Blow stuff up with placed charges that have customizable size!

? Enchant items with software routines

? Spawn boxes for things to be drawn in

? players make agents that manipulate the environment while sleeping (or doing other things)

? Meditation to discover API endpoints for the universe

- Subtle synchronicities that if players follow - will drastically improve their playing experience

? Players can write code for items that can be equiped that can then perform actions based on the code they write
? Item enchantment with code

? Players unlock API
? Some objects are immune to API calls
? Players have API spend/rate/etc

? the source code for an object is the path the player took (placing blocks) to make it

? the voxels could start out large and get progressively smaller as the player advances
? piece components together to build cyborgs

## tokens

- earn tokens to make API calls, these tokens can be specific types of manna or something else.

## puzzles

- [Turret Avoidance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY6jR52fFWo)
- Create a trajectory to shoot a ball through the hoop



## story

While exploring a lost city, a <x>th century player discovers a strange glowing apple growing on a tree.
When the apple is picked up, it expands into a pair of goggles that the player puts on.
Instantly, screens can be placed anywhere in the world and the source code of the world is visible, thus enabling the player
to manipulate matter, if only he can find the right Names of Power.

The player comes across a magician:

(rewrite for the sake of the game " We are about to study the idea of a computational process. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer[matrix] with our spells.

A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.

A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. Thus, like the sorcerer's apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. Even small errors (usually called bugs or glitches) in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences.")

### missions

- Get a food delivery to a person on time: Upload a map to a robot and have it use the map to navigate to the correct location. Or just have it sort things out without a map entirely, just using cardinal directions or something... or street numbers.

## technology
- X Window to allow IDE
  - Direct pixel rendering to keep crisp image
- micro voxel
- C++
- Python API
- Lisp API
- ZeroMQ
- OpenGL
? City recreation based on google streetview (or some similar) - This is starting to seem like a better idea...
? Multiple X windows to allow a browser as well
- recompilable while playing
- snap to flat, draw with pixels


#### Game design loops

- roads with purple and dark grey spacemacs colors


## target audience
- Elon Musk; I want Elon Musk to play this game!
- 16-35 year olds


## Maslows needs

- physiological
    ?housing mechanic
    ?eating/drinking mechanic
    ?cold temps (of NYC!)
- saftey
    ?places where players can have private experiences
