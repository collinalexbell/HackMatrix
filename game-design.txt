? Item enchantment with code

? Players unlock API

## story

While exploring a lost city, a <x>th century player discovers a strange glowing apple growing on a tree.
When the apple is picked up, it expands into a pair of goggles that the player puts on.
Instantly, screens can be placed anywhere in the world and the source code of the world is visible, thus enabling the player
to manipulate matter, if only he can find the right Names of Power.
