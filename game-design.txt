# matrix game design

## Game Theme

- Divine/magical power beyond one's comprehension
  is available to those who seek it
  and learn to harmonize themselves
  with the spirit of the universe

? solar cyborgs
? living in a city filled with cybernetic organisms
? diy ethic
? automated homestead life
? exploring an ancient world that contains cyberenetic artifacts


## mechanics

- Players use an in game IDE to write code that influences the game world
  - Objects in the world are scriptable
  - Objects can be spawned

? Meditation to discover API endpoints for the universe

- Subtle synchronicities that if players follow - will drastically improve their playing experience

? Players can write code for items that can be equiped that can then perform actions based on the code they write
? Item enchantment with code

? Players unlock API
? Some objects are immune to API calls
? Players have API spend/rate/etc

? the source code for an object is the path the player took (placing blocks) to make it

? the voxels could start out large and get progressively smaller as the player advances
? piece components together to build cyborgs



## story

While exploring a lost city, a <x>th century player discovers a strange glowing apple growing on a tree.
When the apple is picked up, it expands into a pair of goggles that the player puts on.
Instantly, screens can be placed anywhere in the world and the source code of the world is visible, thus enabling the player
to manipulate matter, if only he can find the right Names of Power.

The player comes across a magician:

(rewrite for the sake of the game " We are about to study the idea of a computational process. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer[matrix] with our spells.

A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.

A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. Thus, like the sorcerer's apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. Even small errors (usually called bugs or glitches) in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences.")
