- RAII GL resources (VAO/VBO/FBO/Texture wrappers) to avoid state leaks and manual glDelete/glGen.
- Renderer state helper to manage shader bools/uniform toggles with RAII guards.
- Strategy interface for app rendering (X11/Wayland/direct) to unify bind/draw pipeline.
- Texture unit manager encapsulating IndexPool, sampler bindings, and FBO attachments.
- Logging facade for renderer/WM/Wayland with per-channel enables instead of scattered FILE*.
- Split Wayland rendering into dedicated module fed by DTOs (model/scale/focus) to slim renderer.cpp.
- Command pattern for hotkeys in wlr_compositor/WindowManager.
- Enumerated render passes instead of many boolean toggles.
- Simple frame pass scheduler to declare FBO/viewport transitions.
- Hit-testing helper for Space to isolate ray-plane intersection logic.
